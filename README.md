# Microlensing light-curve computation for finite source star lensed by triple lens system

This method is based on the image track connecting method, which is different from traditional inverse ray shooting routine.

After compile with "make" command, the test program can be run as:

```
./bin/testtriple
```

Here we show how the closed image tracks are connected:
